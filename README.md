# janus_native_client_sdk
A native client sdk(ios/android) interacting with Janus gateway as signal, using WebRTC as media. 
Nearly all Janus videoroom's feature are supported.

The project is born in the evrionment of live broadcasting, using RTC for a better communication.

If everything goes fine, I would open source it within a month.
